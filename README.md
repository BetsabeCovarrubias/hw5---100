# AVL Tree
11/2023

In this homework, you are going to manipulate an AVL tree. There will be three functions that
you have to design: Insert, Remove, and print.

## Input files

- This file cannot be empty.

- You can safely consider that all the inputs are positive integers in the correct format.

- While reading the input, \n and \r should be removed before processing the string.

- Each line is going to include a command

- Insert(n) will add n to the AVL

- Remove(n) will remove n from the AVL.

- There shouldn’t be a duplicated number in the tree; you should not insert a number if it
already exists.
## Output:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print each level of a tree from top to bottom; numbers will be separated by “ ”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance: after inserting 4,3,2,5,6

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 5

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 6
